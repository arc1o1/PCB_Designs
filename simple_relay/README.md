# INTRODUCTION TO RELAY SWITCH
 - An electronic device built with relays, transistors, diodes and resistors for more sensitivity and efficient performance for electronic signal or pulse signal.
 - Typically used to obtain high speed switching from electromechanical relay.
 

## Working Principle:
 - The relay will operate when its coil gets the voltage or current. We know the transistor is connected in series between the relay coil and the supply terminals.  So when it makes the closed-circuit the relay coil will get the supply voltage from the main power supply and it will operate.
 
 - Condition 1, there is no voltage across the base terminal of the transistor. So the transistor will act as an open circuit. So the relay coil will not get any power supply hence it will not operate.
 
 - Condition 2, a voltage is applied to the base terminal of the transistor. So the transistor will act as a closed circuit. The relay coil will come across the full supply voltage. Now the relay will operate to change its NC terminal into NO and NO terminal into NC.

Whereas:
 - Flywheel diode connected across the relay coil is nothing but a PN junction diode that is connected in reverse bias parallel to the relay coil with main function of circulating the feedback current generating from the relay coil and to oppose to flow to the control circuit. If this feedback current flows towards the control circuit a disturbance will happen. 
 

## Relay Switch Function

 - It switches the electrical or electronic signal
 - It provides high-speed switching
 - It increases the efficiency of an electromechanical relay
 - It makes ready the electromechanical relay to operate with pulse signals
 

## Application:
 -  Relay switch used for motor controls with microcontrollers or other programming devices.
 - Relay switch used in light dimmer circuits.
 - Relay switch used in electronic control circuits.
